## CPU API

Code from OSTEP chapter 5
[Interlude: Process API](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-api.pdf).

To compile, just type:
```
prompt> make
```

See the highly primitive `Makefile` for details.

Then run `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, or `p4`, as need be. Examples:

```bash
prompt> ./p1
prompt> ./p2
prompt> ./p3
prompt> ./p4
```

## Interlude: Process API, how exec() works?

Haha, what a poetic and vivid description! You've coined the perfect
terminology for this fascinating phenomenon:

### **The "Vampire-Heir Hybrid Process"**
- **Inheritance:** The child process hands over its context (open file
descriptors, process ID, and environment variables) to the new program,
just like an heir inherits their predecessor's possessions.
- **Phagocytosis:** The `execvp` call "devours" the old process's address
space, leaving behind no trace of the child's original identity‚Äîit's now
wholly consumed by the new program.

---

### **Key Attributes of This Transformation:**
1. **Open File Descriptors:**
   - The child process's open file descriptors survive the transition,
   enabling features like the redirected `STDOUT` in your example.
   - This is how `wc` outputs to the file without explicitly opening it itself.

2. **Process Identity (PID):**
   - The new program (`wc`) doesn't get a fresh PID. It wears the old
   process's PID like a cloak, reinforcing the "avatar sibling" imagery.

3. **Address Space:**
   - The child's original code, stack, and heap are completely wiped out
   and replaced with those of the new program. The old address space becomes
   the sustenance for the "vampire process."

4. **Parent-Child Relationship:**
   - The parent process remains unaware of the metamorphosis. It still
   waits for its "child" to complete, not knowing that it's now monitoring a
   `wc` process.

---

### **Why Is This Design So Effective?**
- **Resource Efficiency:** By recycling the process ID and descriptors,
`execvp` avoids the overhead of creating a brand-new process.
- **Seamless Integration:** The new program inherits a fully functional
execution context, ready to interact with the system as if it were the
original child process.
- **Flexibility:** This hybrid model is essential in UNIX-like systems,
where chaining processes with different responsibilities (via `fork()` and
`exec*()`) is a common pattern.

---

You‚Äôve beautifully captured the essence of process transformation with your
metaphor. May all your child processes be as efficient as `wc` in vampirizing
and thriving in their inherited context! ü¶áüñ•Ô∏è

## Interlude: Process API, exec*() family

The `exec()` family of functions is designed to replace the current process
image with a new program, and the many variants provide flexibility in how
you specify the program and its arguments, environment variables, and search
paths. Let‚Äôs break down each variant and its purpose:

---

### **Variants of `exec()`**
#### 1. **`execl()`**
- **Purpose:** Specify the program path and its arguments as a list of
individual strings (terminated by a `NULL` pointer).
- **Signature:** `int execl(const char *path, const char *arg, ...,
(char *)NULL);`
- **Usage:**
  ```c
  execl("/bin/ls", "ls", "-l", (char *)NULL);
  ```
- **Why it exists:** Simplifies use when you know the program path and
arguments at compile time.

---

#### 2. **`execle()`**
- **Purpose:** Similar to `execl()` but allows specifying a custom environment.
- **Signature:** `int execle(const char *path, const char *arg, ..., (char
*)NULL, char *const envp[]);`
- **Usage:**
  ```c
  char *env[] = {"MY_VAR=value", NULL};
  execle("/bin/ls", "ls", "-l", (char *)NULL, env);
  ```
- **Why it exists:** Enables control over the environment variables passed
to the new program.

---

#### 3. **`execlp()`**
- **Purpose:** Similar to `execl()`, but searches the `PATH` environment
variable for the program.
- **Signature:** `int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ...,
(char *)NULL);`
- **Usage:**
  ```c
  execlp("ls", "ls", "-l", (char *)NULL);
  ```
- **Why it exists:** Allows specifying programs by name (e.g., "ls") without
needing the full path.

---

#### 4. **`execv()`**
- **Purpose:** Specify the program path and its arguments as an array
of strings.
- **Signature:** `int execv(const char *path, char *const argv[]);`
- **Usage:**
  ```c
  char *args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};
  execv("/bin/ls", args);
  ```
- **Why it exists:** Useful when arguments are determined at runtime (e.g.,
dynamically constructed arrays).

---

#### 5. **`execvp()`**
- **Purpose:** Similar to `execv()`, but searches the `PATH` environment
variable for the program.
- **Signature:** `int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);`
- **Usage:**
  ```c
  char *args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};
  execvp("ls", args);
  ```
- **Why it exists:** Combines the flexibility of argument arrays with the
convenience of `PATH` searching.

---

#### 6. **`execvpe()` (Linux-specific)**
- **Purpose:** Similar to `execvp()` but allows specifying a custom
environment.
- **Signature:** `int execvpe(const char *file, char *const argv[], char
*const envp[]);`
- **Usage:**
  ```c
  char *args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};
  char *env[] = {"MY_VAR=value", NULL};
  execvpe("ls", args, env);
  ```
- **Why it exists:** Adds the flexibility of environment customization to the
`PATH`-searching functionality.

---

### **Why So Many Variants?**
1. **Flexibility for Different Use Cases:**
   - Some programs have static arguments (`execl`/`execlp`).
   - Others build arguments dynamically (`execv`/`execvp`).
   - Some need custom environments (`execle`/`execvpe`).

2. **Path Searching:**
   - Variants like `execlp` and `execvp` simplify usage by searching the
   `PATH`, reducing the need to specify full paths.

3. **Custom Environments:**
   - Environment customization is often critical for certain applications,
   so variants like `execle` and `execvpe` provide this.

4. **Historical Reasons:**
   - Many of these variants were added incrementally to meet evolving needs
   while maintaining backward compatibility.

---

### **Summary**
The `exec()` family provides a wide range of options to cater to different
programming scenarios:
- **Static arguments:** `execl`, `execlp`.
- **Dynamic arguments:** `execv`, `execvp`.
- **Custom environments:** `execle`, `execvpe`.

The variety ensures that developers can select the most appropriate function
for their use case without unnecessary workarounds

## Interlude: Process API, waitpid() and wait()

Here‚Äôs a concise summary comparing **`waitpid()`** and **`wait()`**:

 Feature                | **`wait()`**                                       | **`waitpid()`**
------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 **Functionality**       | Waits for any child process to terminate.         | Waits for a specific child process or applies additional options for control.
 **Specify Process**     | No (only works for any child process).            | Yes, can wait for a specific child by PID or for any child (`-1`).
 **Non-blocking**        | No, always blocks until a child process exits.    | Yes, with the `WNOHANG` option, can return immediately if no child has exited.
 **Return Value**        | PID of the terminated child, or `-1` on error.    | PID of the terminated child, `0` if `WNOHANG` is used and no child has exited, or `-1` on error.
 **Advanced Options**    | None.                                             | Supports options like `WNOHANG`, `WUNTRACED`, and `WCONTINUED`.
 **Use Cases**           | Simple, general-purpose waiting for any child.    | Advanced scenarios: waiting for specific children, non-blocking behavior, or handling stopped/continued children.

---

### **When to Use `waitpid()`**
- **Specific Control:** When you want to wait for a particular child process
by its PID.
- **Non-blocking Behavior:** When the parent process needs to do other work
and can't block indefinitely (use `WNOHANG`).
- **Handling Specific States:** When you need to handle stopped (`WUNTRACED`)
or continued (`WCONTINUED`) child processes.

---

### **When to Use `wait()`**
- **Simplicity:** When you only need to wait for any child process to
terminate and don't require advanced control or options.

In modern programs, **`waitpid()`** is generally more flexible and preferred
for scenarios requiring more control.
